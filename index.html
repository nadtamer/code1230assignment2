What is data journalism?<br>
The use of data and analysis in journalism to enhance news stories is defined as data journalism. Data can be the tool used to tell a story or the source upon which a story is based. It primarily involves the use of statistics and graphs. Data is a great source for journalists to use as it provides further credibility to sources and clearly breaks down complex topics to the public.<br>

Data journalism has emerged as a new branch of journalism, thanks to the sheer scale of digital information now available and the software that may be used to crunch that data into useful forms. Data journalism is a result of big data, which aims to find exploitable patterns in user data and other information generated by businesses.
“The Scourge of Racial Bias in New York State’s Prisons”, a New York Times investigation which draws on nearly 60,000 disciplinary cases from state prisons and interviews with inmates to explore the system’s inequities and the ripple effect they can have.
